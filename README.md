Search and Recommendation Functionality

This project includes a dynamic search feature that allows users to find travel recommendations based on keywords. Below is a detailed explanation of how the search and recommendation logic is implemented.

The search functionality enables users to enter keywords to receive travel recommendations. For example, entering keywords like "Sydney," "Brazil," or "Australia" will filter and display relevant travel destinations from the provided dataset.

Implementation Details
Fetching Data: Data is retrieved from a local travel_recommendation_api.json file using the Fetch API. The JSON file contains travel-related details including place names, descriptions, and image URLs.
